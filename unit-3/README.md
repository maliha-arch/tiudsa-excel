# Project: Excel / Unit 3

## What I did
- Built a tax calculator with 15 products
- Used absolute reference ($F$2) for tax rate so formula doesn't break when dragged
- Used relative references for price and tax amount columns
- Created a named range "PriceList" for B2:B16
- Used PriceList in SUM formulas to show total price, total tax and total final price

## Files / links
- [Tax_Calculator.xlsx](https://github.com/maliha-arch/tiudsa-excel/blob/main/unit-3/Tax_Calculator.xlsx)

## How to run / verify
- Open Tax_Calculator.xlsx
- Tax rate is in cell F2 (10%)
- Tax Amount column uses absolute reference $F$2
- Named range PriceList defined for B2:B16
- F5:G7 shows named range used in SUM formulas

## Notes / references
- Absolute reference: $F$2 locks the cell so dragging doesn't shift it
- Named range: PriceList = B2:B16
